# kelony_task_one - Spider-map powered by equalizer

Implement a 12-point spider-map fed by numerical csv data that changes shape through the use of
buttons, graphically something like an equalizer for audio mixers. By moving the equalizer slider up
and down or left and right, this should go to change the spider-map graphic (or whatever kind of
graphic element you want to show, not mandatory spider-map); at the moment you can use
random data to feed the spider-map and the equalizer can contain as many sliders as there are
spider-map tips or not. Below the spider-map should also be a score, which changes whenever a
map parameter is changed through the equalizer, and a button for resetting the equalizer to the
initial default situation.
